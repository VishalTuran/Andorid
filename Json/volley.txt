Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking very easy and fast, for Android Apps.

For using add the following dependencies in app level gradle.

For using volley we need a api.

Let's take a fake api for testing

So the url for the fake api is:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1

We will get the data in the following format:

{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}

Volley provides the following class for Json requests:
-JsonArrayRequest: So this kind of request is made when the objects of Json are stored in an Array.

[
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
},
{
  "userId": 2,
  "id": 2,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": true
}
] 

In this example both the object are stored in Array.

-JsonObjectRequest: In this type there is only simple Json object like
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
