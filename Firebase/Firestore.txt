Firestore is a subset of Firebase-Real-Time Database

Firestore is a NOSQL Cloud Database which is extremely,customizable,efficient and scalable.

Unlike SQL,we don't need to specify the column name and entity before putting the data in the table rather in NOSQL we don't need to predefined the structure of the database. 

In case of NOSQL, Database is called collection and Tables are called Documents.

Documents allow us to add key-value pair which is basically the json format because json is easy to manipulate,query and very flexible.

We can add documents inside the collection by specifing its name otherwise firebase we create an id for it.
