onMapReady method add the following line of code:

googleMap.setMyLocationEnabled(true);

Then a button will appear on your map and on clicking the button it will lead the map to our current location.

Advantage:

1) Less Code


Disadvantage:

1) The GPS keeps running and it has massive effect on the battery of the device and we can't control the gps also.
