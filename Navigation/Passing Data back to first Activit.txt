To get the data or result from second activity back to first Activity.

First of change the method:

startActivity(intent);
	To
startActivityForResult(intent,REQUEST_CODE);

because now we are calling the secondActivity but we need something in return.

request code is an integer no. that we can create that will specify which activity or message we are trying to catch.

We will also override a method called onActivityResult() which is used to catch everything send back from SecondActivity.

protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, @Nullable Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        if(requestCode==REQUEST_CODE)
        {
            if(resultCode==RESULT_OK)
            {
                String result=data.getStringExtra("returnData");
                Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,result,Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        }
}

This method will take three parameters.
1)Request Code
2)Result Code:   resultcode is going to tell us what kind of data we are expecting.
3)Intent

As we are the sending the request code through startActivityForResult method.
So we can whether the request code that we are receiving from the second activity is same as we send it and also the result code is equal to RESULT_OK which means everything is right.

In the Second Activity :

Intent returnIntent=getIntent();
returnIntent.putExtra("returnData","From Second Activity");
setResult(RESULT_OK,returnIntent);
finish();

In the first line we are getting the intent using getIntent() method.
Then in the nextline we are putting the value in the intent.
The next line contain setResult method which contains the result code and the intent.
finally we will finish the second Activity.
